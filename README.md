# AWS Deep Thoughts

## Project Description
This project is a version of the Deep Thoughts application (https://github.com/kpehl/deep-thoughts) refactored to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for deployment.  DynamoDB is used for text thoughts, an S3 bucket is set up for hosting images, and the project is hosted on an EC2 instance using an Ubuntu server. This simplified version of the application does not have user accounts. A user simply enters a name and the thought they'd like to share.

## Deployed Application
The application can be seen as hosted on an E2 instance here: http://3.142.212.95/
